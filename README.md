### Libraries

- [Swift Snapshot Testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) - A library I've been using in my work (and in the presentation)
- [Approval Tests](https://approvaltests.com) - A project dedicated to approval testing. You can find a link to implementation in for many programming languages
- [Insta Snapshots](https://insta.rs/) - Insta is an enjoyable snapshot testing tool for Rust

### Previous ADC talks

The idea of snapshot testing has already been covered to some extend in (at least) these talks:

-  [Unit Testing Audio Processors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIcqoDQxoPI&list=WL)
-  [How to Write Bug-Free, Real-Time Audio C++ Code?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvf7VVH53-4)
-  [Test-driven development for audio plugins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLOlRSu6p00)

## Metronome App

This is a simple metroneome written in Swift. It is associated source code for the presentation.

You can download this source code and explore snapshot tests.

Here are two PRs that were covered in the presentation:

- [Fix incorrectly timed MIDI event](https://github.com/jcavar/Metronome/pull/1)
- [Implement count in along with metronome](https://github.com/jcavar/Metronome/pull/3)

And here is one additional PR that hasn't been covered:

- [Optimise metronome DSP](https://github.com/jcavar/Metronome/pull/2)
